//program to show the usage of static variable means its scope is limit and it has a lifetime till the program ends we cannot re-initialize here. 
//If you call this function many times, the local variable will print the same value for each function call, e.g, 11,11,11 and so on.
// But the static variable will print the incremented value in each function call, e.g. 11, 12, 13 and so on.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void func(){
	static int a=10;// it retain its value 
	++a;
	printf("\n %d",a);
}
int main()
{
	func();
	func();
	func();
	return 0;
	getch();
